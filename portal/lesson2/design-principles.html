                <p>The Nike website demontrates the principle of contrast very well. The most noticable
                    aspect is in the color scheme. Nike's whole website is a white background with 
                    black text. This is the highest level of contrast you can have between two colors, so 
                    everything shows up very nicely and is readable. Another source of contrast on this site
                    is the use of curved buttons in contrast with the blocky headings and text. </p>

                <img src="images/church.jpg" alt="screenshot of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints website">
                <p>The website for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints showcases the principle of visual hierarchy
                    very well. The most important information is the largest on the page and it gradually gets smaller from
                    there according to how important it is. The page title of "My Home" lets the user know where they are on 
                    the page. The next largest thing is the name of the account user logged in. The next largest text are the
                    links to the various pages on the site. Then just smaller than that is options to see more and customize 
                    your home screen. This layout makes it very easy for the user to find the information they are looking for.

                <img src="images/roolee.jpg" alt="screenshot of Roolee's mobile website">
                <p>The Roolee site does an excellent job of showing the design principle of repetition 
                    throughout their site. There are several elements found in just this small screenshotted 
                    portion of the site. The two pictures both contain similar shades of green. Going further
                    down the website, several other photos also have a similar green background, so that color
                    is repeated through the site. The font style on those photos is also repeated throughout.
