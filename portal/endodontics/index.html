                    <p>Dr. Justin Thornton was raised in Lima, Montana. While attending college in Idaho, he married
                        his wife,
                        Janet Jenson. They moved to Virginia where he attended dental school at Virginia Commonwealth
                        University.
                        Upon graduating in 1996, he was accepted into the 2-year endodontic residency program at the VCU
                        School
                        of
                        Dentistry. While completing the residency program, he was trained in the latest endodontic
                        techniques
                        including the use of the surgical operating microscope which he uses to complete all treatments.

                <h2 class="mid">What is a root canal?</h2>
                <p> A “root canal” is short for root canal treatment. Which is the removal of pulp tissue from the
                    inside of the
                    tooth and the sealing of that space with a biocompatible material.</p>
                <h2 class="mid">The Process</h2>
                <ol class="steps">
                    <li>The area is anesthetized or “numbed”.</li>
                    <li>The tooth is isolated with a rubber dam.</li>
                    <li>Inside of the roots are cleaned, shaped, and irrigated removing all pulp tissue and bacteria.
                    </li>
                    <li>Following the disinfection process, the space is filled with biocompatible material.</li>
